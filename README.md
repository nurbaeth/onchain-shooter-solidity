## 🎮 Overview
**BlockBlaster** is a simple yet strategic shooting game played on a 5x5 grid, where two players compete by deploying targets and firing limited shots. Everything happens **on-chain**, secured by smart contracts.
    
- 🔫 3 shots per player    
- 🎯 5x5 target grid     
- 🧠 Strategic gameplay   
- ⛓️ 100% on-chain logic      
- 💡 Perfect starter project for learning game logic in Solidity   

## 🛠️ How It Works   
1. **Player 1** creates a game and submits their hidden grid of targets. 
2. **Player 2** joins with their own grid.      
3. Each player submits 3 shots.   
4. The smart contract compares shots vs targets.   
5. The player with the most hits wins.

## 🧱 Game Mechanics
- Each target grid is a `uint8[5][5]` matrix (0 = empty, 1 = target).
- Each shot is submitted as a flattened index: `(x * 5 + y)`.
- The game finishes when both players fire all 3 shots.
- Draws are possible.

## 🔐 Security & Fairness
- To keep things simple, this version does not use commit-reveal (target grids are visible).
- In a future version, commit-reveal or zk proofs can be added for fairness.

## 📄 Contracts
- `BlockBlaster.sol` — main game contract

## 🧪 Tests
Testing can be done using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/):

```bash
forge test
```

## 📦 Deploy
You can deploy with your favorite Solidity framework:

```bash
forge create BlockBlaster --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
