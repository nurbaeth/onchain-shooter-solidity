# onchain-shooter-solidity
BlockBlaster is a simple on-chain shooting game written in Solidity. Players compete by firing limited "shots" at targets on a grid. The game runs fully on-chain: all actions, state, and logic are stored in smart contracts. Ideal for learning how to implement turn-based mechanics and randomness in Solidity.
